# Some Interesting Exercises and Theorems from Axler's Book

---

## Motivation

With this project I aimed to expand my linear algebra understanding given the usefulness it has in computer science fields like machine learning. I also wanted to improve my proof-writing skills by working through selected exercises though I haven't published all the solutions.

## About the book

*Linear Algebra Done Right* by Sheldon Axler is a pretty famous textbook. I chose it because it's free to download and for its abstract approach avoiding the use of determinants and matrix representation as much as possible, focusing instead on linear transformations and vector spaces, leaving the numerical computation aside in the majority of the exercises.

## Want to expand these notes?

This is written in *LaTeX*, as is the official book, download the `main.tex` file and compile it in your terminal with:

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
```
Or open it with whatever latex compiler you have like TexShop or Overleaf.
